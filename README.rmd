This repository host the targeted integration of metabolomics data reported
in [Bilbrey et al. (2022)](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.17693).

The targeted integration is conducted using [ms-mint](https://github.com/LewisResearchGroup/ms-mint).
Compound identification was conducted by comparison of samples against authentic standards, as well
as using public availables MS/MS in GNPS.

More details about the in-house MS/MS library can be found at [PhenolicsDB](https://github.com/CooperstoneLab/PhenolicsDB),
while a representative GNPS molecular network can be found in this
[repository](https://cytoscape.gnps2.org/process?task=1b4d04e4234d47f38ad8681da8307b91).

## Pythochemical target list 

Briefly, we collected full scan data $MS^1$ in both polarities (positive and negative), to achieve a greater
metabolome coverage. In the following table you will find the list of identified metabolites in each polarity.

### Negative polarity

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

target_neg <- read_xlsx("Data/Tables/targets.xlsx", sheet = "target_neg") %>% 
    select(-rt_min, -rt_max) %>%
    mutate(rt = ifelse(rt_unit %in% "min", round(rt * 60, 0), rt) ) %>% 
    select(-rt_unit) %>% mutate(mz_mean = as.character(mz_mean))
print(as.data.frame(target_neg))
```
